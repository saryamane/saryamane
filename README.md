### Hey, I'm Samir Aryamane! ✌

I work as a Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer at Salesforce, and I´m based out of San Francisco, California.

Since 2007, I've been living and breathing data and creating smart data products. I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects, helping to make this world a little better through design, scale & code. ✨😍
